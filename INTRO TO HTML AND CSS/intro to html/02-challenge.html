       <strong>Nobody’s born smart.</strong> We all start at <strong>0.</strong>  Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do <strong>algebra <br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike.</strong> Nobody’s good at anything at first.  <br>
        There was a time when <strong>Einstein couldn’t count to 10.</strong> <br>
        And <strong>Shakespeare</strong> had to learn his <strong>ABCs</strong> just like the rest of us. <br>
        <strong>Thankfully, we are born to learn. </strong><br>
        <strong>Slowly. Surely.</strong> You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall. <br>
       <strong>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</strong>  <br>
        Until one day, <strong>you walk.</strong> <br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next. <br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit  <strong>stronger.</strong> <br>
        <strong>Failing is just another word for growing.</strong> And you keep going. <br>
        <strong>This. is. learning. </strong><br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it,<strong> yet.</strong> Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe <br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand. <br>
       <strong> Whoever you are, wherever you are.</strong> <br>

            <em>
                You only have to know one thing: <br>
            You can learn anything.
