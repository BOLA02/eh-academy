                <p>In this post, Iâ€™ll take you through how I Created  <em>My First Simple Webpage.</em></p>
                <p>Creating my first simple webpage was a significant milestone that marked the beginning of my journey into web development. It was a hands-on experience that fueled my passion for coding and opened up a world of possibilities. Hereâ€™s a look back at how I built my first webpage, the excitement I felt, and the lessons I learned along the way</p>
                <h3>Getting Started</h3>
                <p>
                    With a simple goal in mind, I set out to create a personal blog website. I wanted it to reflect my personality and journey in the new world i found myself.
                    
                    The Building Process
                    Setting Up the Structure: I began with HTML, which provided the backbone of my webpage. I created a basic structure using tags like (html), (head), and (body). This initial setup gave me a clear framework to work within.
                    
                    <em>Adding Content:</em> Next, I filled my webpage with content. I used (h1) for the main heading and (p) tags for my introduction. Adding a simple unordered list for my blog content felt rewarding as I saw everything come together.
                    
                    <em>Styling with CSS:</em> Once i was sure of the content on my html files, I wanted to make my page visually appealing. I introduced CSS to change text colors, fonts, and background styles. Playing around with different styles was exciting, and I learned how to make my webpage more engaging.
                    
                    <em>Incorporating Images:</em> I added images to bring my interests to life. Using the (img) tag, I included pictures to show the challenges faced . It was amazing to see how images could enhance the overall feel of the webpage.
                    
                    <h3>Challenges Along the Way</h3>
                    Creating my first webpage wasnâ€™t without its challenges:
                    
                    <em>Debugging Issues:</em> I faced a few frustrating moments with broken links and misplaced tags. Learning to debug my code and use the browserâ€™s developer tools was a valuable lesson.
                    
                    <em>Design Decisions:</em> Choosing the right colors and fonts was overwhelming at first. I experimented with different combinations until I found a look that felt right for me.
                    
                    <em>Learning Curve:</em> The initial learning curve was steep, but I soon realized that practice was key. The more I coded, the more comfortable I became.</p>
