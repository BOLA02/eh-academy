    <h3>Details</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Popular throughout West Africa, especially Nigeria and Ghana.</li>
        <li>Serves about 4-6 people.</li>
        <li>Savory, slightly spicy, with rich tomato and pepper undertones. It’s a hearty, comforting dish that pairs wonderfully with grilled or fried meats, fried plantains, or a variety of vegetables.</li>
        <li>Prep Time: 15-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cook Time: 40-45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Special Notes: You can adjust the spiciness by varying the amount of scotch bonnet pepper. For a richer flavor, some recipes call for adding a bit of coconut milk or a dollop of butter.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Tomato Base: Blend the red bell pepper, tomatoes, scotch bonnet pepper, and a small part of the onion in a blender until smooth. Set aside..</li>
        <li>Fry the Onions and Aromatics
            <ul>
                <li>In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the remaining chopped onions and sauté for about 5 minutes until soft and golden.</li>
                <li>Add the minced garlic and grated ginger. Stir for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li> 
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Add the Tomato Paste and Cook: Add the tomato paste to the pot and cook it for about 2 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent burning.</li>
        <li>Add the Blended Tomato Mixture: Pour in the blended tomato mixture, thyme, curry powder, and bay leaves. Stir everything together and let it simmer for about 10-15 minutes on medium heat, allowing the flavors to develop. The mixture should reduce and thicken slightly..</li>
        <li>Cook the Rice
            <ul>
                <li>Add the rice to the pot and stir it into the tomato base. Ensure the rice is well-coated with the tomato mixture.</li>
                <li>Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth, then season with salt and black pepper to taste.
                    Stir everything together and bring the mixture to a boil.</li>   
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Simmer and Steam the Rice
            <ul>
                <li>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid.</li>
                <li>Let the rice cook for about 25-30 minutes, checking every 10 minutes to ensure the rice isn’t burning. Add a little more broth or water if necessary, and stir occasionally.</li>   
                <li>After 25 minutes, check if the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed. If the rice is still firm, cover and cook for another 5-10 minutes.</li>   
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Add Optional Peas: If using frozen peas, add them in the last 10 minutes of cooking. Stir gently to combine</li>
        <li>Serve
            <ul>
                <li>Once the rice is fully cooked and the liquid has evaporated, remove from the heat and let it sit for about 5 minutes before serving.</li>
                <li>Fluff the rice with a fork, discard the bay leaves, and serve with your favorite protein (grilled chicken, fried fish, or even some sautéed vegetables).</li>   
        </ul>

    <h3>Details</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Origin: Popular in Nigeria and other parts of West Africa, especially among the Yoruba and Igbo communities.</li>
        <li>Serving Size: Serves 4-6 people.</li>
        <li>Flavor Profile: Rich, nutty, and savory, with a delightful depth of flavor from the egusi seeds, palm oil, and spices. The combination of meat, fish, and vegetables creates a robust, comforting dish.</li>
        <li>Prep Time: 20 minutes</li>
        <li>Cook Time: 40-50 minutes</li>
        <li>Special Notes: Egusi soup is traditionally served with fufu (made from cassava), pounded yam, or rice. It’s a great dish for special occasions or a hearty family meal.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Meat and Stock
            <ul>
                <li>Cut the goat meat (or beef) into bite-sized pieces and place it in a pot. Add enough water to cover the meat, season with one or two seasoning cubes, and cook for about 25-30 minutes until tender.</li>
                <li>If you're using stockfish and dried fish, soak them in warm water for a few minutes to soften, then add them to the pot with the meat.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Fry the Onion and Tomatoes
            <ul>
                <li>In a separate pan, heat the palm oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and cook for about 5 minutes until softened and translucent.</li>
                <li>Add the blended tomatoes and cook for another 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. If using fresh peppers, blend them with the tomatoes or chop and add them in at this stage.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Prepare the Egusi Paste
            <ul>
                <li>In a small bowl, mix the ground egusi with a little bit of water to form a thick paste.</li>
                <li>Once the tomato mixture has cooked down and thickened, add the egusi paste into the pot, stirring to combine. Be sure to stir the paste continuously to prevent it from clumping.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Cook the Egusi
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Add the meat stock (or chicken broth) into the pot with the egusi paste, stirring gently. Bring to a simmer and let the soup cook for about 10-15 minutes. You should notice that the egusi will begin to "bloom" and absorb the flavors from the palm oil and tomato.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Add Fish and Seasoning
            <ul>
                <li>Add the softened stockfish and dried fish (if using), and any additional seasoning cubes or salt to taste. Stir to combine. Continue to simmer for another 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Add Vegetables
            <ul>
                <li>Once the soup is thick and well-cooked, add your chopped spinach (or ugu leaves). Stir well, and cook for an additional 5 minutes until the spinach is tender and fully incorporated.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Finish the Soup
            <ul>
                <li>If you're using ground crayfish or locust beans (iru/ogiri), add them at this stage and stir through the soup.
                </li>
                <li>Taste the soup for seasoning and adjust with salt or seasoning cubes as needed.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Serve
            <ul>
                <li>Once the soup is cooked to your desired consistency, remove from heat and serve hot. Pair with fufu, pounded yam, or rice for a satisfying meal.</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>Details</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Origin: Popular in Nigeria and across West Africa. It’s typically enjoyed as an appetizer or a main dish, especially during rainy seasons or after a long day, as it's believed to have medicinal and healing properties.</li>
        <li>Serving Size: Serves 4-6 people.</li>
        <li>Flavor Profile: Spicy, aromatic, and tangy with a rich depth of flavor. The combination of fresh fish, herbs, and spices makes it very comforting.</li>
        <li> Prep Time: 15 minutes</li>
        <li>Cook Time: 25-30 minutes</li>
        <li>Special Notes: The soup is flexible; you can use any fresh fish of your choice, or chicken and goat meat for variations. You can adjust the spice levels to suit your preference by controlling the amount of scotch bonnet or chili peppers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
       <li> Prepare the Fish
        <ul>

<li>Clean the fish and cut it into bite-sized pieces. If using whole fish, remove the scales, gut, and clean properly. You can also ask your fishmonger to do this if you prefer.</li>
<li>Season the fish with a pinch of salt and set aside while you prepare the broth.</li>
</ul>

<li>Prepare the Broth
    <ul>
<li>In a large pot, add the water and bring to a boil.</li>
<li>Add the chopped onions, minced garlic, minced ginger, scotch bonnet peppers (or fresh chili), and seasoning cubes. Stir everything to combine and allow it to boil for about 10 minutes. This will form the base of the pepper soup.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
Add the Spices: Add the ground black pepper, uda seeds (or alligator pepper, if using), and any other spices you’re using (e.g., thyme or basil) to the broth. Stir and allow it to simmer for 5 minutes so the spices can release their flavors.
</li>

<li>
Add the Fish
<ul>
<li>Gently add the fish pieces to the pot, making sure they are submerged in the broth. Be careful when stirring to avoid breaking the fish apart.</li>
<li>Let the soup simmer on medium heat for about 10-12 minutes, until the fish is cooked through and tender.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
Add Fresh Scent Leaf or Basil
<ul>
<li>Add the fresh scent leaves (or basil) to the soup and stir gently. These herbs add an aromatic flavor to the soup, which is characteristic of pepper soup.</li>
<li>Allow the soup to simmer for another 3-5 minutes. If using palm oil, you can add a tablespoon at this point for added flavor and color.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
Taste and Adjust
<ul>
<li>Taste the soup for seasoning and adjust the salt and pepper to your liking. You can also add more scotch bonnet pepper if you want it spicier.
Serve</li>
<li>Once the fish is tender and the soup has reached your desired spice level, remove from heat and serve hot.</li>
<li>Pepper soup is best enjoyed with a cold drink or with sides like boiled yam, rice, or even fried plantains (dodo) for a complete meal</li>
</ul>
</li>
</li>
    </ol>
